[anaconda_dl]: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
[Eclipse]: http://www.eclipse.org
[PyDev]: http://www.pydev.org
[conda_env]: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html
[install ScopeFoundry]: /docs/1_getting-started/
[Qt Creator]: https://www.qt.io/offline-installers

- If you have not already, install [ScopeFoundry](/docs/1_getting-started) using `pip`.

- For code editing or an IDE, we recommend one of the following options:
   1. [**VS Code**](/docs/100_development-environment/15_vs-code): At the time of writing, VS Code offers more advanced features for code review and editing and is potentially easier to use.
   
   2. [**Eclipse**](/docs/100_development-environment/10_setup_eclipse/): Ideal for live coding and debugging. 
   
      
   
- For version control, we recommend using [**Git**](/docs/100_development-environment/20_git/).

- For interactive user interface development, install [Qt Creator][Qt Creator]. This tool allows for the interactive creation of Qt user interface files (`.ui`).
