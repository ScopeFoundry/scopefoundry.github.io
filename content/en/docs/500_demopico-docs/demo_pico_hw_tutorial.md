## The Hardware

We will use a simple microcontroller that will blink an LED and read brightness from a photoresistor. We will program it with CircuitPython

Plug in your fresh Raspberry Pi Pico W and it will show up as a USB drive called `RPI-RP2`

Download UF2 file for CircuitPython 9.1.1 and copy the `adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico_w-en_US-9.1.1.uf2` to the `RPI-RP2` drive

After the copying is complete a new USB drive will appear called `CIRCUITPY`
