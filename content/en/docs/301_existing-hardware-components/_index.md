The following is a list of hardware component plug-ins created for use with ScopeFoundry. If you have a device you would like to use with ScopeFoundry and it is not listed below, you can learn to create a custom hardware plugin by following [this tutorial](/docs/11_tools-tutorials/2_hardware-1/).

This page periodically crawls GitHub for HW_* repos. Thereby, it considers users/organizations that forked the ScopeFoundry Repo. To contribute follow [instructions here](/docs/200_hardware-sharing/).
