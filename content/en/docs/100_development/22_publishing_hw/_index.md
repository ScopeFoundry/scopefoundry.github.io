The following instructions publish   `company_model`  in your_project_folder's `ScopeFoundryHW` 

```
├── your_project_folder
    ├── ScopeFoundryHW
     	├── company_model
     		├── company_model_hw.py					
     		├── Licence
     		├── README.md
     		# optional
     		├── company_model_dev.py			
     		├── company_model_test_app.py
     		├── .gitignore
     		├── ** more files/directory that make your hw component work
     		
     **
```

with a recommended `.gitignore` as we generally do not recommend to track measurement and log data:

```.gitignore
*.pyc
*.h5
*log*.txt
```

If you like to adhere to this [template use ScopeFoundry.tools](/docs/11_tools-tutorials/2_hardware-1/#the-template) to generate the folder structure.

## Publish your hardware

1. Initialize git repositiory localy (`cd ScopeFoundryHW/{company_model}`)

   ```sh
   git init --initial-branch=main
   ```
   
2. Commit your code. If it is the first commit, assuming you commit all at once:

   ```sh
   git add -A && git commit -m "Initial release"
   ```

3. Create the target repo on GitHub by prepending `HW_` to the package:

   1. sign-up/log-on on GitHub with your `USER_NAME` 
   2. New (repository) to make a public repo named `HW_{company_model}`
      ![create_repo](create_repo.png)
      3. note the repo url for the next step![repo_created](repo_created.png)


4. Push your code to the remote repo

   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/{USER_NAME}/HW_{company_model}.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### Discoverable on this page

This page periodically crawls GitHub for HW_* repos. Thereby, it considers users/organisations that forked the ScopeFoundry Repo. So this page will find your hw repo if 

- you fork [ScopeFoundry/Scopefoundry](https://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry)
- Indeed label your Hardware repo starting with `HW_`



## Adding published plug-ins to your project

Assuming:

- urls `https://github.com/{THEIR_USER_NAME}/HW_{company_model}.git`
- `cd to/your_project_folder/` and use the following cmd (requires [git](/docs/100_development/20_git/))

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{THEIR_USER_NAME}/HW_{company_model}.git ScopeFoundryHW/{company_model}
```

HINT: The entries of [reference/hw-components](/docs/300_reference/hw-components/) contain this line filled out. 

Note: We removed the prepended `HW_`.

## Updating to already published plug-ins

If it is **not** your repo or you do **not** have write access:

- Sign up/log on github with your  `USER_NAME`
- fork the original repo

Now you should have github repository url of the form: `https://github.com/{USER_NAME}/HW_{company_model}.git`  Here we push to the branch `master`.

1. go the folder you of the hardware
   ```sh
   cd to/your_project_folder/ScopeFoundryHW/{company_model}
   ```

2. Commit your code. To wrap all changes in one commit (not necessarily recommended)
   ```sh
   git add -A && git commit -m "describe your contribution"
   ```

4. Push your code to the remote repo
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/{USER_NAME}/HW_{company_model}.git
   git push -u origin
   ```


If you'd like to share your updates with the original owner then create a Pull Request on GitHub.
