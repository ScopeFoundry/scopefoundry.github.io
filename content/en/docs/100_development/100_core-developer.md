If you would like to have a local copy of ScopeFoundry to modify within your microscope repository, we recommend to make a local copy. (`cd to/your_project_folder`)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry.git
```

Then your tree should look like: 

	├── .git/				# Stores Git repository information
	│   └── ...
	├── ScopeFoundry/			# Local Sub-tree of ScopeFoundry (overrides pip installed scopefoundry)
	│   └── ...
	├── ScopeFoundryHW/ 			# Local copies of ScopeFoundry hardware plugins
	│   ├── virtual_function_gen/		# Local sub-tree of specific hardware plugin
	│   └── ...
	└── fancy_app.py

If you want to make contributions to the ScopeFoundry project:

1. fork on GitHub

2. `cd to/your_project_folder/ScopeFoundry`

   ``` bash
   git remote add https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/ScopeFoundry.git
   ```

3. create a pull request on GitHub.
