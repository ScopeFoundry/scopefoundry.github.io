ScopeFoundry provides a DataBrowserApp that makes it easy for a user to explore a set of experimental results on their computer. It is a plug-in-based application, where data-type plug-ins (a `DataBrowserView`) can show relevant data within the file. 

The [FoundryDataBrowser project][FoundryDataBrowser] is an example of the ScopeFoundry DataBrowser with a number of Views used to browse common experimental data at the Molecular Foundry.
