Built in Measurements where the following cycle repeats:

1. Change the position, voltage, ... in predetermined way
2. Collect data

ScopeFoundry 2.2 introduced generic sweeping and scanning Measurements that work out of the box but can also subclassed, see [sweeping](sweeping).

Previously, [BaseRaster_scan](Baseraster-scan) were base classes that facilitated implementing scanning Measurements.

For your own Measurement from scratch read [this tutorial](/docs/11_tools-tutorials/3_measurement/) where [this](/docs/30_tips-and-tricks/settings-ranges/) might be useful.
