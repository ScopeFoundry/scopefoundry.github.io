Sweep a setting, collect any setting, run any measurement, or define your own `Collector` to handle data collection.

This class can either be used as a standalone tool or subclassed to add more capabilities.

An example can be found by creating a new app using [ScopeFoundry tools](/docs/11_tools-tutorials/1_new-microscope-app/).
